## Kilauea 2014-2015 pahoehoe flow field

This folder contains the files to simulate the pahoehoe flow field which formed at Kilauea volcano (Hawaii) between June 27, 2014 and June 8, 2015 (Patrick et al. 2016). 

This lava flow has been defined as a specific episode of the long-lasting Pu'u 'Ō'ō eruption started on 1983 and still ongoing at the time of writing. On June 27, 2014, the opening of new vents on the north flank of Pu'u 'Ō'ō changed dramatically the hazard potential of the ensuing lava flows, because vents were on the north side of the topographic crest of the East Rift Zone (ERZ), and lava advanced in a general northeast direction, posing a threat to the village of Pahoa and other inhabited areas (Patrick et al. 2016). After having reached the boundary attained by preceding Pu'u 'Ō'ō lava flows (7-8 km from the vent), from mid August 2014 lavas entered repeatedly pre-existing ground cracks along the East Rift Zone, and continued to advance northeastwards for a few kilometers almost hidden from view due to the thick rainforest. In early September lava returned to the surface, heading in a more northward direction, and continued advancing (discontinuously) until March 2015. 

Given the complexity of the whole episode, and the peculiar presence of the ground cracks (mostly below the resolution of the 20 m-cell size topography used here), we decided to simulate only the terminal segment, setting a computational vent along the ERZ where lava exited from the ground cracks (at least in part) to flow again on the surface. 

This simulation has been supported by USGS colleagues based at the Hawaiian observatory, which provided the digital elevation model (the 20-resolution NED topography, Gesch et al., 2002) and lava coverage in addition to input settings such as an estimation of the volume of lava flowed through the computational vent considered.
